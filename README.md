DEPRECATED: This software we used to modify sleep behavior of macOS on laptops with lid closed. As of today it's no longer maintained, and same behavior could be achieved by using `pmset` or `caffeinate` utilities shipped with the OS. Please use this project only as an example of simple kext implementation.

NoSleep
=======

The MacOS X kernel extension, preventing sleep when you close the lid.
